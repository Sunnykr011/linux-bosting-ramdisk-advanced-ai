## ðŸš€ What Happens After Reboot?

1. On every boot:
   - RAM disk (`/mnt/ramdisk`) is mounted
   - Script from `/opt/ramdisk-script` is copied into RAM
   - Executed from RAM directly (super fast)

2. Output:
```bash
[+] Running from RAM disk at ...
[+] Performing high-speed operation...
[+] Done. This was fast and clean.
